# IDL syntax highlighting

This package provides a simple IDL syntax highlighting, derived from Sublime's standard C++ highlighting. It provides you with correct symbol detection (`cmd+r`), which was the main reason to create this. 

Nothing fancy stuff here, no additional functionality, no snippets
