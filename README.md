# IDL syntax highlighting
 
This package provides a simple IDL (Microsoft, midl) syntax highlighting, derived from Sublime's standard C++ highlighting. It provides you with correct symbol detection, which was the main reason to create this. 

No fancy stuff here, no additional functionality, no snippets
